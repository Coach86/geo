# Sidebar Changes Summary

## What Changed

1. **Removed Lock Icon**: The lock icon is no longer displayed for restricted features when on a free plan.

2. **Click Behavior**: When a free plan user clicks on a restricted feature (Sentiment, Alignment, Competition), they are redirected to `/update-plan` instead of seeing a disabled link.

3. **Visual Styling**: Restricted features now have the same visual appearance as accessible features, but with a pointer cursor to indicate they're clickable.

4. **Tooltip**: The tooltip still appears on hover to inform users they need to upgrade.

## How It Works

- The sidebar checks if a feature is locked for free plan users
- When clicked, it prevents the default navigation and redirects to `/update-plan`
- The visual distinction (opacity, colors) has been normalized to match other menu items
- The tooltip provides context about why the redirect happens

## Testing

1. Log in as a free plan user
2. Try clicking on Sentiment, Alignment, or Competition in the sidebar
3. You should be redirected to the `/update-plan` page
4. Visibility and Explorer should work normally
