# Empty Defaults Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Default Data Constants
**File**: `/app/onboarding/types/form-data.ts`

#### Before:
- `DEFAULT_BRAND_DATA` had pre-populated competitors and a default US market
- `DEFAULT_PROMPT_DATA` had 15+ pre-populated visibility prompts, 5 perception prompts, and 10 LLM models
- All models were hardcoded with details

#### After:
```typescript
export const DEFAULT_BRAND_DATA: BrandData = {
  markets: [],
  attributes: [],
  competitors: [],
};

export const DEFAULT_PROMPT_DATA: PromptData = {
  visibilityPrompts: [],
  perceptionPrompts: [],
  comparisonPrompts: [],
  llmModels: [],
};
```

### 2. Created Missing ModelsReview Component
**File**: `/components/onboarding/confirmation/ModelsReview.tsx`

- Added a new component to handle the display of selected models in the confirmation step
- Handles empty state gracefully with a message that models will be configured after plan activation
- Shows selected models with their details (name, provider, web access, badges)

### 3. Updated Exports
**File**: `/components/onboarding/confirmation/index.tsx`

- Added export for the new `ModelsReview` component

## How Empty States Are Handled

### 1. Brand Identity Component
- Auto-populates from analyzed data if available
- Shows empty state suggestions when no data exists
- Handles empty attributes and competitors arrays gracefully

### 2. Prompt Selection Component
- Fetches prompts from API instead of using hardcoded defaults
- Shows loading state while generating prompts
- Handles empty prompts array with appropriate messaging

### 3. Model Selection
- Models are fetched from the API endpoint `/user/organization/models`
- No hardcoded models in the frontend
- Empty models array is handled in pricing calculations (defaults to 0)
- ModelsReview component shows appropriate empty state message

### 4. Pricing Page
- Requirements calculator handles empty states properly
- Model count defaults to 0 when no models are selected
- Plan recommendations work correctly with empty data

## Benefits

1. **Clean Initial State**: No pre-populated demo data that might confuse users
2. **Dynamic Data**: All data comes from user input or API calls
3. **Proper Empty State Handling**: UI components gracefully handle empty arrays
4. **API-Driven Models**: LLM models come from backend, allowing for dynamic updates without frontend changes

## Testing

The build completed successfully with these changes, confirming that:
- All components handle empty arrays properly
- No runtime errors from missing default data
- Type safety is maintained throughout
