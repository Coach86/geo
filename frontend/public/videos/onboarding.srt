00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,072
Hello everyone, this is Mathieu from Mint.

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:08,021
Welcome to our beta. While your first project analysis is

3
00:00:08,022 --> 00:00:11,248
being run, and will be displayed in a few minutes,

4
00:00:11,574 --> 00:00:14,718
I recorded this short video to give you a first tour of the platform,

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,937
and I will show you how to best use it.

6
00:00:18,054 --> 00:00:22,948
here is your home, where you can see the different projects that you have

7
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:27,680
and will be creating. The first thing that you can do in terms of

8
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:30,724
setting up the project and having the right analysis used to go.

9
00:00:30,725 --> 00:00:33,199
And review the project settings.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,972
here you can review the domain name that you are analyzing the

11
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:41,527
focused market and the main language that would be useful prompt.

12
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:45,152
and then you can edit and play around with the different.

13
00:00:45,163 --> 00:00:48,645
project parameters, you can work on the competitor set,

14
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:53,411
you can also expand and improve your visibility from

15
00:00:53,412 --> 00:00:55,880
set along the way by either editing.

16
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:57,079
In a single prompt,

17
00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:00,202
or by adding new ones. If you want to track new topics,

18
00:01:00,213 --> 00:01:03,091
you can do the same for the alignment analysis.

19
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:05,143
here the idea is to have the right,

20
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:09,713
brand attributes or information that will be fact checked in the

21
00:01:09,714 --> 00:01:10,604
different LLM,

22
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:11,244
answers.

23
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,014
you can add some attributes,

24
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:14,241
clients are using,

25
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:16,901
key brands attributes, such as specific information.

26
00:01:16,902 --> 00:01:21,859
That they would like to see displayed in the LLM answers or specific items,

27
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,432
such as pricing,

28
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:24,471
commission fees, etc., etc.

29
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:28,828
you can play with the, in defining the right attributes for your brand.

30
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:31,179
And these are all produced.

31
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,948
But if you want to make adjustment to the fact-checking alignment prompts,

32
00:01:34,949 --> 00:01:36,212
you can also pin it in here.

33
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:40,562
same for a sentiment. This is a pretty generic and standard analysis.

34
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:43,697
But if you feel that you want to specify,

35
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,888
some small adjustment to, the sentiment prompts,

36
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:47,696
you can also edit them here.

37
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,522
last thing on, on the setup part is the account settings.

38
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:54,302
if you need to adjust your, the plan that you would be using ad

39
00:01:54,303 --> 00:01:56,610
users or select other AI models,

40
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:58,242
you can do everything here.

41
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:02,712
that was for the project and account setting parts and now I suggest that

42
00:02:02,713 --> 00:02:05,327
we jump into the analysis and,

43
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:07,776
join your, your first project.

44
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,306
here you are entering the inside.

45
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:13,380
The section of the mean platform.

46
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:17,422
and I will walk you through the different inside that you can gather and

47
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:18,275
track over time.

48
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:19,867
based on the setup that we just,

49
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:20,857
looked at.

50
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:25,384
the, the first step is to understand and track your

51
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:26,407
visibility score.

52
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:27,223
this is the,

53
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:31,755
percentage of mention that your brand is getting across the

54
00:02:31,756 --> 00:02:34,953
visibility prompt that we have just looked at.

55
00:02:34,964 --> 00:02:36,969
and here you can compare your brand,

56
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,227
against your competitors.

57
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:43,004
that you have defined, but also the entire industry show voice that

58
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:47,792
you are getting, including other competitors that you have not mentioned in,

59
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:48,773
your project setup.

60
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:51,226
keep in mind that you can,

61
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:52,580
Always,

62
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:56,563
check the date and range of the report that you want to look at,

63
00:02:56,564 --> 00:02:59,557
or the model selection as well, if you want to only have a look

64
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,337
to a single model or a setup.

65
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,674
last thing here, once you, you've looked at your visibility score,

66
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:09,923
that you've tracked it over time, is also to dig into the domain ranking,

67
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,947
looking at the sources that have been consulted by models,

68
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:16,817
to generate the answers on the visibility answers,

69
00:03:16,828 --> 00:03:20,879
and also check whether this, the sources of belonging to your own assets or

70
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,125
owned by third parties. Second thing is the sentiment of elementers,

71
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:28,344
the modelers' answers towards your brain.

72
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:33,076
Here we're tracking with the sentiment prompts whether the answer is coming from

73
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:36,659
the, whether it's a positive neutral or negative toward your brain.

74
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,037
the idea is to have a look at the overall trend,

75
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:43,310
whether the sentiment score is positive or not.

76
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:47,394
And then to dive into the details of getting into the,

77
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:48,639
the specific,

78
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,911
answers model by model. For example,

79
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,204
here I'm entering one Gemini answer.

80
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,942
what do you think about Lovable? And I can go through the

81
00:03:57,943 --> 00:04:02,849
answer, check the positive items and also keep in mind.

82
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:08,008
The different weaknesses or limitations that the models are pointing out to users

83
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:09,942
that would be researching your brand.

84
00:04:10,285 --> 00:04:13,659
you can get into the details and also have a look at the intermediate

85
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,795
queries that can be formulated by models.

86
00:04:16,128 --> 00:04:18,851
All the citations, the websites that are being used.

87
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:21,165
To make the answer.

88
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:25,943
likewise, you can go deeper into the analysis by looking at all the sources

89
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:30,759
that have been consulted by models that you can filter out by either the

90
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,233
kind of models and the sentiment.

91
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:35,606
If you want to look at a specific category,

92
00:04:35,617 --> 00:04:39,857
and what we truly believe is that the real value lies into the,

93
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:40,991
into the details,

94
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:44,214
Next up is alignment.

95
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,499
here we're looking at,

96
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,685
reinforcing your brand protection,

97
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:50,870
and compliance across the model's answer.

98
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:53,763
you can track your overall alignment score.

99
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:58,927
That would be deep. The average of all the model's answer across all attributes.

100
00:04:58,938 --> 00:05:02,361
here, again, the idea is to make sure that the,

101
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:04,472
present representation and that the,

102
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:09,058
characteristic that you're- would like to see displayed to users using

103
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,850
AI search or being,

104
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:12,807
being displayed correctly.

105
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:15,782
you can have a look at any attributes,

106
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:20,442
treated by any model and- and do the same good- into the details

107
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:23,800
of- of understanding what is the answer,

108
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:25,964
what are the intermediate queries,

109
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:29,173
what are the citations, the website that have been consulting to,

110
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:32,126
to build the- the answer. Similarly,

111
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:36,909
you can go into the- sources details to make sure that you,

112
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,844
for example, have a look at the sources that would be misaligned with the

113
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:42,919
brand that's enriched that you want to understand.

114
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,514
For instance, here, the team at Lovable would be interested in understanding why the,

115
00:05:48,157 --> 00:05:52,960
for example, here, the rapid developer. This source is not aligning with the messages

116
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:57,039
that I want to, that I want to see this play. Last insight,

117
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,875
analysis that we are offering to you is the competitive

118
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:02,792
landscape analysis,

119
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:06,414
here we are comparing you. Your brand versus the selected competitors,

120
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:08,177
where you can see if,

121
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:11,308
the prospect of the client is researching your brand,

122
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:16,096
your brand against another one, what would be the strength and the weaknesses

123
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:18,029
that would be displayed in the answers.

124
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,263
for all the other sections, you can also go into the sources and understand

125
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:23,441
what are the,

126
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:26,757
exact sources that are being consulted and where you could have,

127
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:27,962
potentially influence,

128
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:30,052
going forward. The last,

129
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:34,605
and the last interesting section is the Data Explorer.

130
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:39,021
Here the idea is that you have the full database of all the links

131
00:06:39,377 --> 00:06:42,560
that I've been consulting throughout the different prompts,

132
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:46,438
throughout the different models, and to build the first report.

133
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,381
and here the idea is that you can,

134
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:54,137
feature out this database by the internet queries that are being used

135
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:55,289
in the indexes.

136
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,003
you can have a focus on sources, on model,

137
00:06:58,004 --> 00:07:02,530
on prompt. If I want to have a look on the visibility,

138
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:06,786
the organic one, if I want to understand if Wikipedia is being used or,

139
00:07:07,138 --> 00:07:08,653
Reddit is being also talked about.

140
00:07:08,857 --> 00:07:11,736
you can play around with the database and understand,

141
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:14,628
what were the factors of, of in-prem. For every answer,

142
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:18,544
and you can also export it to CSV to make sure that you really

143
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:21,683
go deeper into the analysis and start optimizing by,

144
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:22,792
potentially influencing,

145
00:07:22,803 --> 00:07:24,978
some of your content, for instance,

146
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:28,762
on your own domain, but also third-party contents once you- have,

147
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:29,690
identify it.

148
00:07:30,435 --> 00:07:31,512
this is it for now,

149
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:36,044
the first quick tour of all the inside picture that we've

150
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:40,917
been for you so far. I'm looking forward to hearing from you

151
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:45,662
using the beta, getting your- feedback, and hopefully you will enjoy

152
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,684
using mint as much as we do. Thank you very much.

153
00:07:48,686 --> 00:07:49,138
See you soon.
