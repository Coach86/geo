# Free Plan Feature Blur Implementation

## Overview
Instead of redirecting free plan users to /update-plan when accessing premium features, the implementation now shows mock data with a blur overlay and upgrade prompt.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Feature Blur Components
- **FeatureBlurOverlay** (`/components/shared/FeatureBlurOverlay.tsx`): Shows upgrade prompt overlay
- **FeatureLockedWrapper** (`/components/shared/FeatureLockedWrapper.tsx`): Wrapper component that applies blur effect

### 2. Mock Data Generator
- **mock-data.ts** (`/lib/mock-data.ts`): Generates realistic mock data for:
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Alignment Analysis  
  - Competition Analysis

### 3. Updated Feature Pages

#### Sentiment Page (`/app/(protected)/sentiment/page.tsx`)
- Removed redirect logic for free users
- Added mock data generation when `isFreePlan` is true
- Wrapped content with `FeatureLockedWrapper`

#### Competition Page (`/app/(protected)/competition/page.tsx`)
- Removed redirect logic for free users
- Added mock data generation when `isFreePlan` is true
- Wrapped content with `FeatureLockedWrapper`

#### Alignment Page (`/app/(protected)/alignment/page.tsx`)
- Removed redirect logic for free users
- Added mock data generation when `isFreePlan` is true
- Wrapped content with `FeatureLockedWrapper`

### 4. Updated Feature Access Hook
- Modified `useFeatureGate` to no longer redirect
- Returns access status without side effects

### 5. Updated Sidebar
- Removed redirect on click for locked features
- Keeps tooltip showing "Upgrade to access [feature]"
- Allows navigation to feature pages

## How It Works

1. **Free Plan Detection**: The system identifies free plans using the same criteria as before

2. **Mock Data Display**: When a free user accesses a premium feature:
   - The page loads normally
   - Mock data is fetched instead of real API data
   - Content is displayed with reduced opacity (30%)
   - Blur overlay is applied

3. **Upgrade Prompt**: An overlay card appears with:
   - Lock icon
   - Feature name and description
   - "Upgrade to Unlock" button → redirects to /update-plan
   - "View Pricing Plans" button → redirects to /pricing

4. **User Experience**:
   - Free users can see what premium features look like
   - Data is blurred and non-interactive
   - Clear upgrade path is provided

## Testing

1. Log in as a free plan user
2. Click on Sentiment, Alignment, or Competition in the sidebar
3. Verify:
   - Page loads with mock data
   - Content is blurred with overlay
   - Upgrade buttons work correctly
   - No redirects happen automatically
