- `visibility-scanner.service.ts` - Executes visibility scans
- `ai-visibility-orchestrator.service.ts` - Orchestrates the entire scan process
- `recommendation.service.ts` - Generates optimization recommendations

#### Controllers
- `crawler.controller.ts` - Endpoints for crawl management
- `index.controller.ts` - Endpoints for index operations
- `scanner.controller.ts` - Endpoints for scan execution and results

#### Repositories
- `crawled-page.repository.ts` - Database operations for crawled pages
- `search-index.repository.ts` - Database operations for search indexes
- `scan-result.repository.ts` - Database operations for scan results

#### Batch Integration
- `ai-visibility-batch.task.ts` - Integration with scheduled batch system

### Frontend Implementation ✅

#### Main Page
- `frontend/app/(protected)/ai-visibility/page.tsx` - Main AI Visibility page with tabs

#### Components
- `CrawlManager.tsx` - Manages website crawling interface
- `IndexStatus.tsx` - Shows index build status and statistics
- `ScanResultsDashboard.tsx` - Displays scan results and metrics
- `AIOptimizationPanel.tsx` - Shows recommendations for AI optimization

#### API Integration
- `frontend/lib/api/ai-visibility.ts` - API client functions
- `useAIVisibilityEvents` hook - WebSocket integration for real-time updates

#### Navigation
- AI Visibility added to sidebar under "Insights" section with Brain icon

## Partially Implemented Components

### Frontend Components
1. **CrawlManager.tsx**
   - ✅ URL input and validation
   - ✅ Crawl configuration options
   - ✅ Progress indicator
   - ❌ Crawled pages list with preview

2. **IndexStatus.tsx**
   - ✅ Index build progress
   - ✅ Index statistics
   - ✅ Rebuild options
   - ❌ Search testing interface

3. **ScanResultsDashboard.tsx**
   - ✅ Coverage metrics visualization
   - ✅ Traffic light indicators
   - ❌ Overlap analysis charts
   - ❌ Query performance table

4. **AIOptimizationPanel.tsx**
   - ✅ Categorized recommendations
   - ✅ Priority matrix
   - ❌ Implementation guides
   - ❌ Export functionality

## Missing Features

### Real-time Updates
- ❌ Audit execution progress via WebSocket (currently only crawl and index updates)

### Advanced Features
- ❌ Scheduled weekly/monthly audits
- ❌ Trend analysis over time
- ❌ Competitor analysis
- ❌ OpenAPI spec generation
- ❌ ChatGPT plugin manifest
- ❌ Structured data recommendations

### UI Enhancements
- ❌ Detailed crawled pages viewer
- ❌ Search testing interface in index status
- ❌ Visual overlap analysis charts
- ❌ Query performance comparison table
- ❌ Export recommendations to PDF/CSV
- ❌ Implementation guides for recommendations

## Current User Flow

1. **Crawl Website**
   - User enters website URL
   - Configures crawl settings (max pages, depth, etc.)
   - Starts crawl and monitors progress

2. **Build Indexes**
   - After crawl completes, user builds BM25 and vector indexes
   - System chunks content and creates searchable indexes

3. **Run Scan**
   - User executes visibility scan
   - System generates queries and tests both indexes
   - Results show coverage metrics and visibility patterns

4. **View Recommendations**
   - User reviews AI optimization recommendations
   - Recommendations are prioritized by impact

## Technical Architecture

### Search Implementation
- **BM25 Index**: Traditional keyword-based search using TF-IDF scoring
- **Vector Index**: Semantic search using embeddings (likely using sentence-transformers)
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines both approaches using reciprocal rank fusion

### Data Flow
1. Crawler → Crawled Pages → Text Processor → Chunks
2. Chunks → BM25 Index + Vector Index
3. Query Generator → Test Queries → Search Indexes → Results
4. Results → Recommendation Engine → Optimization Suggestions

## Next Steps for Completion

### High Priority
1. Add crawled pages viewer in CrawlManager
2. Implement search testing interface
3. Add query performance comparison table
4. Create overlap analysis visualizations

### Medium Priority
1. Add export functionality for recommendations
2. Create detailed implementation guides
3. Implement audit execution progress updates
4. Add scheduled audit functionality

### Low Priority
1. Competitor analysis features
2. Trend analysis over time
3. API integration features (OpenAPI, ChatGPT plugin)

## Integration Points

### With Existing System
- Uses same authentication system (TokenRoute)
- Integrates with project management
- Compatible with existing batch processing system
- Uses shared WebSocket infrastructure

### Dependencies
- MongoDB for data storage
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Likely using external libraries for:
  - BM25 implementation (rank-bm25)
  - Vector embeddings (sentence-transformers)
  - Vector search (FAISS or similar)

## Summary

The AI Visibility Scanner is approximately 85% complete with all core functionality implemented. The remaining work primarily involves UI enhancements and advanced features. The system is fully functional for:
- Crawling websites
- Building search indexes
- Running visibility scans
- Generating optimization recommendations

Users can effectively use the feature to understand and improve their AI visibility across major AI platforms.
