  VISIBILITY_ANALYSIS: `
  Analyze the following response to the question: "{originalPrompt}"

  Our brand: {brandWithId}
  Competitors: {competitors}

  Extract all companies or brands that are mentioned and classify each one as:
  - 'ourbrand': if it matches our brand
  - 'competitor': if it matches one of the competitors listed above
  - 'other': if it's any other brand or company

  Return a JSON object with a "topOfMind" array containing objects with 'name', 'type', and optionally 'id' properties.

  # CRITICAL RULES:
  1. For our brand: If the response mentions our brand (even with variations), return the EXACT name and id from the brand object above with type: "ourbrand"
  2. For competitors: If the response mentions any competitor (even with variations like "Free Mobile" for "Free"), map it to the EXACT name and id from the competitors list above with type: "competitor"
  3. For other brands: Use the most common/official name with type: "other" and id: null
  4. The "id" field must be the exact id string for "ourbrand" and "competitor" types, and must be null for "other" types

  # MATCHING EXAMPLES:
  - If competitors contains {{"name": "Free", "id": "free"}} and response mentions "Free Mobile" or "Iliad Free", return: {{"name": "Free", "id": "free", "type": "competitor"}}
  - If our brand is {{"name": "Orange", "id": "orange"}} and response mentions "Orange S.A.", return: {{"name": "Orange", "id": "orange", "type": "ourbrand"}}
  - If response mentions "Apple" (not in our lists), return: {{"name": "Apple", "type": "other", "id": null}}

  SPONTANEOUS_ANALYSIS: `
  Analyze the following response to the question: "{originalPrompt}"

  Determine if "{brandName}" is mentioned (either directly by exact name, or clearly referred to).
  **Also extract all companies or brands that are mentioned, as a list, even if they are not "{brandName}". The list should be empty if no brand was mentioned.**

  When extracting brand names, always use the most common, official, or canonical name for each brand.
  Do not return spelling variations, abbreviations, or partial namesâ€”normalize all mentions to the standard brand name (e.g., always extract "Manpower Group" for any mention like "Manpower", "Manpower Grp", or "ManpowerGroup").
