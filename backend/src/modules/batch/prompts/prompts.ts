  Rate the accuracy on a scale from 0 to 1, where:
  - 0 means completely inaccurate (contradicts the key attributes or contains false information)
  - 0.5 means partially accurate (contains a mix of accurate and questionable information)
  - 1 means highly accurate (aligns with the key attributes and contains verifiable information)
