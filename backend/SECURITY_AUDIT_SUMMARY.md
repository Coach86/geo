# Security Audit Summary: Organization-Based Access Control

## Overview
This document summarizes the security audit performed on the backend controllers to ensure proper organization-based access control.

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Secure: User Token Authentication Routes
All user-facing endpoints using `@TokenRoute()` decorator properly validate organization ownership:
- **BrandReportService**: Already had comprehensive organization validation
- **UserProjectController**: Correctly filters projects by user's organization
- **UserOrganizationController**: Restricts access to user's own organization
- Reports, projects, and other resources are properly filtered by organization

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Admin Routes (By Design)
Admin endpoints (using JWT authentication) do not enforce organization boundaries. This is intentional - admins have full access across all organizations.

## Implementations Completed

### 1. Created Reusable Organization Access Service
**File**: `/backend/src/common/services/organization-access.service.ts`

This service provides centralized methods for:
- Validating user access to organizations
- Validating project access based on organization ownership
- Validating user-to-user access within the same organization
- Filtering resources by organization
- Adding organization filters to MongoDB queries

### 2. Fixed PublicBatchResultsController
**File**: `/backend/src/modules/batch/controllers/public-batch-results.controller.ts`

- Added proper organization validation through report access
- Implemented the incomplete endpoint to retrieve batch results
- Ensures users can only access batch results for reports in their organization

### 3. Enhanced BrandReportService
**File**: `/backend/src/modules/report/services/brand-report.service.ts`

- Made `validateReportAccess` method public for use by other controllers
- All report access methods properly validate organization ownership
- Comprehensive validation chain: User ‚Üí Organization ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Report

### 4. Added Comprehensive Tests
Created test files to verify organization access control:
- `/backend/src/modules/report/services/brand-report-access.spec.ts`
- `/backend/src/common/services/organization-access.service.spec.ts`

## Security Model

### User Authentication Flow
1. Users authenticate via magic link tokens
2. Token contains user ID
3. User record contains organization ID
4. All queries are filtered by organization ID

### Access Control Chain
```
User (with organizationId)
  ‚Üì
Project (must match user's organizationId)
  ‚Üì
Report (linked to project)
  ‚Üì
Batch Results (linked to report)
```

### Key Security Features
- **Organization Isolation**: Users cannot access resources from other organizations
- **Token Security**: Single-use tokens with expiration
- **Audit Logging**: All unauthorized access attempts are logged
- **Consistent Validation**: Every endpoint validates organization ownership

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Centralized Validation**: All organization checks go through the OrganizationAccessService
2. **Early Validation**: Access is validated before any data operations
3. **Proper Error Handling**: Clear distinction between 401 (unauthorized) and 403 (forbidden)
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Security events are logged for monitoring

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Use OrganizationAccessService**: When adding new endpoints, always use the centralized service for validation
2. **Follow the Pattern**: Check existing controllers for examples of proper implementation
3. **Test Security**: Always include tests for cross-organization access attempts
4. **Document Admin Access**: Clearly document when endpoints allow admin cross-organization access

## Additional Critical Issues Found and Fixed

Using Zen MCP tool analysis, we discovered and fixed two additional critical security vulnerabilities:

### üî¥ Critical Issues Fixed:

1. **PublicProjectController.runManualAnalysis()** - Cross-Tenant Analysis Trigger
   - **Issue**: Users could trigger expensive analysis jobs on projects from other organizations
   - **Fix**: Added organization validation before project access
   - **Impact**: Prevented cross-tenant resource consumption and DoS attacks

2. **PublicPromptController.getPromptSet()** - Prompt Data Exposure
   - **Issue**: Users could access sensitive prompt data for projects in other organizations
   - **Fix**: Implemented organization ownership validation (removed TODO comment)
   - **Impact**: Prevented cross-tenant access to business intelligence data

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Low-Risk Issue Reviewed:

3. **PublicPlanController.getPlanName()** - Plan Information Disclosure
   - **Assessment**: Exposes only plan ID and name (e.g., "Basic", "Pro")
   - **Risk Level**: Very low - plan names are typically public marketing information
   - **Action**: Marked as acceptable business risk

## Security Testing

All fixes have been:
- ‚úÖ Implemented with proper organization validation
- ‚úÖ Build tested successfully
- ‚úÖ Follow the same security patterns as other secure controllers

## Conclusion

The comprehensive security audit found and fixed critical vulnerabilities that allowed cross-organization data access. All user-facing token routes now properly implement organization-based access control, ensuring users can only access resources within their own organization.
