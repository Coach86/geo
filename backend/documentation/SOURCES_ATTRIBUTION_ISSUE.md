# Sources Attribution Issue - Analysis Summary

## Problem Statement
User reported that "Sources attribution is not populated anymore in /visibility endpoint"

## Investigation Findings

### The Issue Was Actually Working Correctly
After thorough investigation with debug logging, we discovered that **Sources attribution (domainSourceAnalysis) WAS being populated and returned correctly**.

### What the Data Showed
For the SFR telecom project analyzed:
- **Brand Domain**: 0% (no citations from sfr.fr)
- **Other Sources**: 100% (161 citations from third-party sites)
- **Competitor Breakdown**: Empty (no citations from orange.fr, bouyguestelecom.fr, or free.fr)

### Root Cause
The Sources attribution appeared "not populated" because:
1. All citations were from third-party sources (selectra.info, bfmtv.com, arcep.fr, etc.)
2. No citations came from the brand's own website (sfr.fr)
3. No citations came from competitor websites

This is **expected behavior** for visibility analysis - LLMs typically cite independent review sites, news outlets, and comparison websites when discussing brands, rather than the brands' own websites.

### Technical Details
The system correctly:
1. Fetches project data including website and competitorDetails
2. Extracts domains from citations using explorer.webSearchResults
3. Classifies domains as brand/competitor/other
4. Calculates percentages and returns domainSourceAnalysis

### Conclusion
No fix was required. The feature is working as designed. The perception that it wasn't populated was due to the data showing 100% "Other Sources" rather than a mix of brand/competitor/other sources.
