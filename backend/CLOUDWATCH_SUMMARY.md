# CloudWatch Logging Configuration Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Task Definition Updates** (`task-definition.json`)
- Optimized CloudWatch log configuration with proper settings
- Added environment variables for log control:
  - `LOG_LEVEL`: Control logging verbosity (default: "info")
  - `LOG_FORMAT`: Output format (default: "json")
  - `ENABLE_CLOUDWATCH_LOGS`: Enable CloudWatch optimizations (default: "true")

### 2. **Enhanced Logger Configuration** (`cloudwatch-logger.config.ts`)
- Structured JSON logging for CloudWatch
- Automatic metadata enrichment (service, environment, version, region)
- Proper error handling with stack traces
- Environment-aware configuration

### 3. **Logger Service** (`logger.service.ts`)
- Request-scoped logging with automatic context enrichment
- Specialized logging methods:
  - `logApiCall()`: Track external API calls with duration
  - `logDatabaseOperation()`: Monitor database performance
  - `logBusinessEvent()`: Track business metrics
  - `logPerformance()`: Monitor slow operations
  - `logSecurityEvent()`: Security audit trail

### 4. **Logger Module** (`logger.module.ts`)
- Global module for dependency injection
- Provides LoggerService throughout the application

### 5. **App Module Integration**
- Conditional logger configuration based on environment
- Automatic switching between development and CloudWatch modes

## Quick Start

### Using the Logger

1. **Basic Logging** (existing code works as-is):
```typescript
private readonly logger = new Logger(MyService.name);
this.logger.log('Operation completed');
```

2. **Enhanced Logging** (with metadata):
```typescript
constructor(private readonly logger: LoggerService) {}

this.logger.log('Project created', {
  projectId: project.id,
  organizationId: project.organizationId,
});
```

3. **Performance Tracking**:
```typescript
const start = Date.now();
// ... operation ...
this.logger.logPerformance('project.analysis', Date.now() - start);
```

### CloudWatch Queries

Find slow operations:
```
fields @timestamp, metadata.operation, metadata.duration
| filter metadata.action = "performance" and metadata.duration > 3000
| sort metadata.duration desc
```

Track errors by user:
```
fields @timestamp, metadata.userId, @message, level
| filter level = "error"
| stats count() by metadata.userId
```

## Benefits

1. **Structured Logging**: All logs are in JSON format for easy querying
2. **Automatic Context**: Request ID, user ID, and metadata automatically included
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in duration tracking for operations
4. **Security Auditing**: Dedicated security event logging
5. **Cost Optimization**: Non-blocking mode and proper buffering
6. **Zero Code Changes**: Existing Logger usage continues to work

## Next Steps

1. Deploy with updated task definition
2. Create CloudWatch dashboards for key metrics
3. Set up alarms for errors and slow operations
4. Configure log retention policies
5. Gradually adopt enhanced logging methods in critical paths
