## Implementation Details

1. The `objectives` field was made:
   - **Required** in the database schema
   - **Optional** in create/update DTOs (following the existing pattern)
   - **Included** in all response DTOs

2. The field represents business objectives and goals of the company, typically 1-2 paragraphs describing their mission, vision, and strategic objectives.

3. The LLM prompt was updated to specifically request this information when analyzing companies from URLs.

4. All compilation errors were resolved and the project builds successfully.

## Testing
The backend project builds successfully with no TypeScript errors after these changes.
